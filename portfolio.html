                    as well as the shop name, which means that each item the shop offers
                    is a star in its own right, waiting to be discovered by its buyer!

                    The Comet was a birth of the combination, which I also gave meaning too: <q><i>Like comets

                    <b>Mika</b> is a shop name for perfumes. The shop name was not made by me but my client.
                    I had few drafts, which can be seen on the right. But the client liked the one above the most.
                    It's simple and captures the fragrance element that they wanted. It wasn't easy to do this
                    one, but for my first time doing a commission, it was a lot of fun!

                    Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan, as someone who loves reading manga, I had
                    the urge to make one for the project, and I got a perfect score for it. It was really hard to make, and
                    a lot of efforts was put into it.
