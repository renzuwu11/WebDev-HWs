Note: 
      
      For some instance, the layout of my portfolio differs on different devices, and
      I can't seem to figure out how to fix it. Instead, I also made a PDF file, where
      I took a screenshot of how does the site should actually look like, because thats
      what it looks like in my end. Thank you so much!


PS:

      On the contents/projects part, the numbers can be clicked po, and it will re-direct
      you to that project~
